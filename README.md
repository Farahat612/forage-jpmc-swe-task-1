# JPMC Software Engineering Program - Task 1

This repository contains my solutions for Task 1 of the JPMC Software Engineering Program.

## Description

Task 1 focuses on developing a stock price data processing application. The application retrieves stock quotes from a server API, calculates the stock price based on the provided data, and performs various data analysis tasks.

The repository includes the following files:

- `client3.py`: The main application file with the implemented logic for retrieving stock quotes, calculating stock prices, and generating data points.
- `client_test.py`: The unit test file with test cases for the methods in `client3.py`.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Instructions

To run the application and execute the unit tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the `client3.py` file using Python: `python client3.py`.
3. To run the unit tests, execute the `client_test.py` file: `python client_test.py`.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and add more test cases to further enhance the application.
